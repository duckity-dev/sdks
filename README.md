# Duckity SDKs

Welcome to the Duckity SDKs repository! Here we keep all SDKs, each under their platform directory.

## Documentation

To check a SDK's documentation, visit the `README.md` file located under their platform folder. For
example, the Rust SDK's documentation is at `rust/README.md`.

## All SDKs

The current SDKs are:

1. Rust
2. WASM
3. Python 3

## Contributing

Contributions of any kind are welcome! Suggestions, issues, PRs, and everything else goes into our
[SDKs repository in GitHub](https://github.com/duckity-dev/sdks). We reward good contributions with
Duckity credits 😉
